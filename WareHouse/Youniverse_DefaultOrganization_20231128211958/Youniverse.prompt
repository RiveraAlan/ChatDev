An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story.
