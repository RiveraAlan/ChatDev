**task_prompt**: An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story.

Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story. |

[2023-28-11 21:20:09 INFO] Chief Technology Officer: **[Start Chat]**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story.".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in `book_generator.py` is referenced but not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<REVISION>
In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```python
from book_generator import Page
```

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and allow it to be used in the `CustomChildrensBookApp` class.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in `book_generator.py` is referenced but not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<REVISION>
In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```python
from book_generator import Page
```

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and allow it to be used in the `CustomChildrensBookApp` class."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in the `book_generator.py` file is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```python
from book_generator import Page
```

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and make it accessible in the `main.py` file.

After making this change, the `Page` class can be used in the `generate_book` method of the `BookGenerator` class in the `book_generator.py` file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in the `book_generator.py` file is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
In the `main.py` file, add the following import statement at the top of the file:

```python
from book_generator import Page

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and make it accessible in the `main.py` file.

After making this change, the `Page` class can be used in the `generate_book` method of the `BookGenerator` class in the `book_generator.py` file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in `book_generator.py` is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
In the `main.py` file, add the following line at the top of the file, after the existing import statement:

```python
from book_generator import Page
```

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and make it accessible in the `main.py` file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Page` class in `book_generator.py` is not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `Page` class in the `main.py` file.

<Instructions>
In the `main.py` file, add the following line at the top of the file, after the existing import statement:

```python
from book_generator import Page
```

This will import the `Page` class from the `book_generator.py` file and make it accessible in the `main.py` file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: An agency that will take shopify orders from a store that creates custom childrens books. The clients when buying a custom childrens book will provide an image of the child, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and any additional customization they want. The ai agents will take this information and create a childrens book tailored to that child. Then a quality department will verify the story meets requirements and hand it off to the art department which will generate an ai image for each page of the book using the image of the child to create an illustration of that child as the main character in the story. This will go through the quality department again to make sure the images match the story and the kid and maintain a consistent character throughout the story..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
tkinter
```

In this case, the `numpy` package is required with a specific version of `1.19.2`, the `pandas` package is required with a minimum version of `1.1.4`, and the `tkinter` package is required for the user interface.

You can add any other required packages or dependencies to this file, each on a new line, following the format `package_name==version` or `package_name>=version`.

Make sure to include this `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory so that it can be easily used for installation and dependency management.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
tkinter
```
In this case, the `numpy` package is required with a specific version of `1.19.2`, the `pandas` package is required with a minimum version of `1.1.4`, and the `tkinter` package is required for the user interface.
You can add any other required packages or dependencies to this file, each on a new line, following the format `package_name==version` or `package_name>=version`.
Make sure to include this `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory so that it can be easily used for installation and dependency management. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

# Custom Children's Book App User Manual

## Introduction

The Custom Children's Book App is a software application that allows an agency to take Shopify orders from a store that creates custom children's books. The app uses AI agents to generate a personalized children's book based on user-provided information such as the child's image, name, gender, age, book theme, story setting, storyline preferences, favorite colors, and additional customization options. The app also includes a quality department that verifies the story and images of the book to ensure they meet the requirements. The art department generates AI images for each page of the book using the child's image as the main character.

This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to install the app's dependencies and how to use the app to generate custom children's books.

## Installation

To install the Custom Children's Book App, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to install the app.

3. Clone the ChatDev repository from GitHub by running the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ChatDev/CustomChildrensBookApp.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the `CustomChildrensBookApp` directory:

   ```
   cd CustomChildrensBookApp
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
